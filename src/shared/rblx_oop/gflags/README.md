How is this different from config? 
- It's not really that differnt. This is just
formatted the same way as FFlags and behaves more like it.

- I liked FFlags. I got sad it was removed. :d <-- me when fflags was removed
- Also acts a root of **all** settings, no profiles for GFlags are supported natively. Although support can be added via external means.
